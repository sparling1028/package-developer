# package-developer
A python package to automate away the housework of writing a sourceable package or module.  
You can now write and continuously develop a sourceable module directly from your IDE of choice, without ever opening a script file.

After saving this code somewhere on your python PATH, you will need to change the references to:
- developer_root
- src_package_root

While I hope to automate that as well at some point, I haven't yet.
These are the locations where "package-developer" will be manipulating files, so put this somwehere where you don't already have a bunch of important things.
Put is somewhere new.

This is still considered an unstable version.
I'm hopful that you will test it out, find it useful, but also find all the things that are broken.

Enjoy!
